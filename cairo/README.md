## ⚠️ Note from Aspect Team ⚠️
This repo is a fork of the OpenZeppelin contracts. The reason for the fork was to have long string support for `tokenURI` on ERC721 contracts. This is required to show images on Aspect.

When OpenZeppelin support long strings TokenURIs for ERC721, we will defer the standard to OpenZeppelin and follow their standards.

# Deploy `TokenURI` Compaitable ERC721 Cairo Contracts on `Aspect`

Deploy `/cairo-contracts/openzeppelin/token/erc721/ERC721_Mintable_Burnable_LongTokenURI.cairo` to StarkNet to have the NFTs available for trading on [Aspect](https://aspect.co/). Please see the [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/) for more information on deploying contracts.

# OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts
[![Tests and linter](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

**A library for secure smart contract development** written in Cairo for [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/product/starknet/), a decentralized ZK Rollup.

> ## ⚠️ WARNING! ⚠️
> This is repo contains highly experimental code.
> Expect rapid iteration.
> **Do not use in production.**

## Installation

### First time?

Before installing Cairo on your machine, you need to install `gmp`:
```bash
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev # linux
brew install gmp # mac
```
> If you have any troubles installing gmp on your Apple M1 computer, [here’s a list of potential solutions](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22).

### Set up the project
Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts.git
```

`cd` into it and create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd cairo-contracts
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the [Nile](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile) dev environment and then run `install` to get [the Cairo language](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html), a [local network](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/), and a [testing framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/).
```bash
pip install cairo-nile
nile install
```

## Usage

### Compile the contracts
```bash
nile compile
